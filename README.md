# Small Quiz Game
This is a small quiz game with 5 questions (as for now). It picks a random question (out of 5 questions) and none of the question is repeated, when you type "Yes" or just simply "y" in the option asking you to continue or not. The 5 questions are fixed but the sequence is different every time you play the game.
This Quiz is expandable to more no. of questions.
Futher, the quiz will provide with an additional choice to choose the topic of the quiz.
